# Security Policy

Although this repository is primarily educational, we still take security and privacy seriously. Please follow these guidelines to report vulnerabilities or sensitive disclosures related to the **NoSQL Databases Labs**.

## Supported Versions

We currently maintain the latest `main` branch. Historical tags or archived lab versions are provided as-is and may not receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. **Email** `diogo.ribeiro@ua.pt` with the subject line `nosql-databases-labs vulnerability`.
2. Include:
   - A clear description of the issue and potential impact.
   - Steps to reproduce or proof of concept (screenshots, scripts, data samples).
   - Any mitigating factors or proposed fixes, if available.
3. Allow at least 5 business days for an initial response before disclosing publicly.

Please **do not** open public GitHub issues for security reports or leaks of student data, grades, or credentials.

## Scope

- Repository code, scripts, and datasets.
- CI workflows and automation.
- Documentation or lab instructions that might expose secrets or sensitive infrastructure details.

Out of scope:

- Third-party services not controlled by the maintainers (MongoDB Atlas accounts, personal GitHub forks, etc.).
- Non-production lab environments that are intentionally insecure for pedagogical purposes.

## Coordinated Disclosure

We appreciate coordinated disclosure. After verifying the issue, maintainers may request additional time to deploy a fix before public disclosure. Credit will be given in release notes unless you request anonymity.

Thank you for helping keep the community safe while learning NoSQL databases!
