# NoSQL Databases Labs

## Introduction

This repository contains the work developed during the NoSQL Databases laboratories, carried out in an academic context. The main goal of this project was to allow the group to acquire both practical and theoretical knowledge about NoSQL databases, with a particular focus on MongoDB, and to understand how they differ from traditional relational databases.

Throughout the different labs, several fundamental concepts, best practices, and real-world use cases were explored, reinforcing learning through hands-on implementation.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this work were:

- Understand the concept of NoSQL databases and their different types
- Learn how to model data in document-oriented databases
- Use MongoDB to create, query, and manage data
- Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete)
- Apply advanced queries and aggregation operations
- Understand concepts such as indexing, performance, and scalability
- Work with supporting tools such as Docker to configure the development environment

## Group Learning Outcomes

During the development of this project, the group acquired several important skills and concepts, including:

### NoSQL Concepts

- Differences between relational and NoSQL databases
- Advantages and disadvantages of using NoSQL in different scenarios
- Importance of schema flexibility

### MongoDB

- Creation and management of databases and collections
- Insertion, reading, updating, and deletion of documents
- Use of filters, projections, and sorting in queries
- Application of the Aggregation Framework for data analysis
- Creation of indexes to improve performance

### Data Modelling

- Proper structuring of documents
- Decision-making between embedding and referencing
- Impact of data modelling choices on performance and maintainability

### Tools and Environment

- Use of Docker and Docker Compose to set up the development environment
- Project organization into different folders (labs, exercises, scripts, and data)
- Validation of results through tests

### Teamwork

This project also contributed to the development of important teamwork skills, such as:

- Task distribution among group members
- Collaborative problem-solving
- Knowledge sharing and peer support
- Improvement of technical communication

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project was essential for consolidating knowledge about NoSQL databases, providing a strong practical foundation for understanding the operation and benefits of MongoDB. The skills and concepts learned throughout this work will be valuable in future academic projects and in real-world application development, particularly in systems that require scalability and flexibility.
