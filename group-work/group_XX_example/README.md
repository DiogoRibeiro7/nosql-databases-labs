# Group XX Example

This folder contains a complete, instructor-provided sample of the final project deliverables so that every group understands the expected depth and structure.

- 📂 `project/` – fully working example that follows `group-work/instructions/project_guidelines.md`.
- 🧠 Focus – shows how to keep everything inside mongosh scripts (no `mongoimport`, drivers, or ORMs).
- ✅ Use it as a benchmark for folder layout, documentation tone, and query coverage. Do **not** copy it verbatim into your own submission.

> Tip: run `mongosh project/import_data.mongosh.js` from this folder to bootstrap the sample dataset locally, then execute the scripts inside `project/queries/` to explore the analysis flow.
